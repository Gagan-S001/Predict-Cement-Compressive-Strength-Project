# Predict-Cement-Compressive-Strength-Project

This project develops a regression model to predict the compressive strength of concrete based on its mix components and curing time. The model supports decision-making in construction quality control and planning.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: Public dataset (UCI or similar)
- **Features**: Cement, slag, ash, water, aggregates, age
- **Target**: Concrete compressive strength (MPa)

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Scikit-learn (LinearRegression)
- Seaborn, Matplotlib

## 🚀 Key Steps
- Imported and explored concrete mix dataset
- Conducted data cleaning and EDA
- Trained a **Linear Regression** model to predict strength
- Evaluated using R², MAE, MSE, MAPE
- Generated predictions for new concrete input values

## 📈 Model Performance
- Model: Linear Regression
- Metrics:  
  - R² Score  
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
  - Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
